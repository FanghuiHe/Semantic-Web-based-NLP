## Unsolved Problems

### Ning:
1. How do we deal with **CHANGES APPLIED TO OBJECTIVES** by a verb?\
E.g. **SIT** = Sit yourself plz; **MAKE** someone cry;

In the discussion I had with Chris, Chris suggested something...

2. What should be the primitive(s) for the word **PARTICIPATE**?
3. How to deal with auxiliary verbs? We shouldn't just ignore them (put NONE for these words since they do alter meanings of verbs followed by them.\
One possible way: put these auxiliary verbs in an independent list since there are only a finite amount of them.

4. Does Chris still have a question about "it rains heavily?"

5. We have **MBUILD** but no **PBUILD**, why?

6. This is a note: I know Jamie said something about **TEND**, but I can't find where the reply is...


### Chris

1. We may need to consider the verbs which may cause the status of the OBJECT to change. Can we add another primitive especially for the OBJECT? E.g. I create the machine. machine => START
