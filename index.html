Sunday: </br>
-> Reviewed Chapter 3 CD; </br>
-> Discussed how to turn the words in our spreadsheets into lisp. </br>
- Ning translated some of the verbs and words like sad, dead, ill, gravely ill, etc., into lisp, but was unsure about how the program can read my code. Need to talk with Jamie about general rules (definitions like '<==').</br>
- Chris tried to write a web crawler, or some machine learning thing, not sure. It's not working right now. She explained to me about why she thinks this should somehow help. I don't agree with her for many reasons but I agree with her experimenting on this kind of things. We'll see.</br></br>

Monday:</br>
Talked again with Jamie about the structure of dypar, and how to add STATECHANGE for indicating changes in HEALTH,etc..</br></br>

Wednesday::</br>
Worked again on words in the spreadsheet. Raised some questions and Chris has documented them. Progress: 10 words/150.</br></br>

Thursday: </br>
Group meeting. Talked about some of the problems we have. </br></br>

Saturday and Sunday:</br>
Got 50 words done.</br>
