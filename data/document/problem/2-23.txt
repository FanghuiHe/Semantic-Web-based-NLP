Q1: For sentence like "I bring you something", how do we make the sentence differentiate between the two objects?
	Says, the exp after "object" is '(human animal) and the exp after "to" is '(human animal mental-object physical object).
	How does the program recognize "you" is actually after "to" and "something" is after "object"? Will the program recognize variables 
	according to the order?

Q2. How to deal with sentences like “I lead you to the success.” I feel like the verb “lead” doesn’t have a good primitive. 
	It’s not mtrans, neither ptrans, nor move. It’s more like “believe”. 
	Should we use EXPECT to start a instrumental CD?

Q3. How to represent causality?
	We would use result to start an instrumental CD.

Q4. How to deal with verbs involving sense organ? Like “I hear something”.
      	We would keep the actor as “I”, and then use an instrumental CD to involve sense organ. We can compare this with the example in the book.
