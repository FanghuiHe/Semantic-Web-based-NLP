### Ning:

Maybe we should add a primitive that represents **CHANGE OF STATUS**.\
What fall under this category:\
**START**, **BEGIN**, **STOP**, **CONTINUE**, **PAUSE**, **RESUME**, **KEEP**, **MAINTAIN**, **CHANGE**, **ALTER**, **BECOME**, **TURN** (e.g. something TURNs red)...

Maybe also **BUILD**, because the most essential meaning of **BUILD** is "to START something, bring somthing into exsistance."

**LIVE** should also be classified into this category since it is a maintenance of the status "being alive<sup>1</sup>" (it should also have **MOVE** as its primitive because we do want computers to know that living indicates, more or less, some signs of life, e.g. heartbeats, neuronal activiteis, etc.)

We might also need a primitive that represents **GENERATE**, physically or abstractly.\
What fall under this category:\
**BUILD**, **CREATE**, **SERVE**, **PROVIDE**...

**SERVE** is here because when the action takes place, some kind of service will be "generated/built". The same for **PROVIDE**.
